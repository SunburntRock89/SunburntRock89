# 👋 Hey there!

I'm Rhys, a TypeScript developer from the Northern Ireland who decided it was about time to create a GitHub Read Me :)

## GitHub
Most of my projects are contained in private repositories. Most of what you find on here was written in an attempt to teach myself JavaScript. 
If you'd like to see some recent code I've written, take a look at [DTel](github.com/DTel-HQ/DTel)

Some of my other exports include Novus FM and Lunus
